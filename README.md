# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis_Challenge-_7

## Purpose
In response to the silver tsunami, the purpose of the first deliverable was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, while the second deliverable's purpose was to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program for Pewlett Hackard. Will the mentorship program, be able to help the Pewlett-Hackard's silver tsunami?

## Results
### Deliverable One- The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
Pewlett-Hackard is most at risk of losing its senior engineers(n=25,916) and senior staff to retirement(n=24,926).
The company is least likely to lose its managers to retirement (n=2).

### Deliverable Two- The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program.
Among employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program, only 937, given their professional backgrounds, have the professional potential to replace the retiring senior engineers; specifically: assistant engineers (n=89), engineers (n=506), senior engineers (n=342). 
And among staff eligible to participate in the mentorship program, only 913, given their professional backgrounds, have the possibility of replacing senior staff; specifically: staff (n=424) and senior staff (n=489). 

### Summary
There are 1,942 employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program at Pewlett-Hackard, but there are 133,776 with the potential to retire.  As a result, it does not seem that those enrolled in the mentorship program, with its current eligibility criteria, will be able to replace all lost to retirements. Thus intense recruitment will likely need to commence and investment in labor saving technology.
